This `docs/` directory contains a static replica of https://career-compass--dheerajkpemail.replit.app/ intended for GitHub Pages deployment.

How to deploy:

1. Commit these files on the `main` branch.
2. In your GitHub repo settings -> Pages, set the source to the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.
3. Save and wait a minute — your site should be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Notes:
- I created a lightweight static replica under `docs/` without modifying any existing project files.
- If you want an exact pixel-perfect copy, I can fetch and inline the original site's CSS and images next.
